EasyCloak
=========

The addon now supports the following features:

* Equip Ony Cloak when entering Nefarian's Lair
* Equip Ony Cloak when targeting Firemaw/Ebonroc/Flamegor (optional)
* Unequip Ony Cloak when Nefarian or drakes die, postpone unequip after combat/ress if necessary
* If multiple cloaks are in the inventory, select the one that is soulbound, otherwise pick any
* If the addon attempts to equip a non-bound cloak, you have to accept

In case the name of the previous cloak wasn't saved (e.g. client crash or alt+f4), you will receive a chat message to change your cloaks manually.

Usage is rather simple, just install it. Only configuration is enable/disable equip on drakes:

    /ec   [or /easycloak]
prints currenty configuration (ON/OFF)

    /ec toggle   [or /easycloak toggle]
switches from ON to OFF and vice versa and prints new config

Also I'd like to thank Vaegar for his support and give a shout out to the incredible amount of boars that sacrificed their lives during development.
